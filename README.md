# Constraints limiting the work

With just 5 hours there is a lot missing here. In a "real" project I would have a well defined design system and use a framework
so I can setup everything from spacings, colors, typography beforehand. Would do it in a way that you can do small changes without changing many files.

Also there is a lot of utility, packages, configurations, naming that I would fix.
